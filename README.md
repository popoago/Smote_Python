The assignment foccuses on solving the problem of class imbalance frequently observed in classification datasets.
I had to implement from scratch the pseudocode provided for SMOTE(T,N,k) algorithm.	
SMOTE.pdf contains the paper from which the algorithm was implemented along with a dataset on which it was tested.
